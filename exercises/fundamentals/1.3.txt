1.  Implemented in basic.stack.FixedCapacityStackOfStrings and basic.stack.FixedCapacityStack
2.  was best times of the was the it
3.  b, f, g
4.  Implemented in basic.stack.client.Parenthesis
5.  Prints the binary representation, takes the last bit (N % 2), shifts all right (N/2) and repeats, the
    stack makes sure they come out in the correct order as they are computed in reverse order
6.  Reverses the order of the elements in the queue
7.  Implemented in basic.stack.FixedCapacityStack, basic.stack.FixedCapacityStackOfStrings,
    basic.stack.LinkedListStack and basic.DynamicCapacityStack
8.  Assume size starts at 1 for most interest!
