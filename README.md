Algorithms
==========

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms following the Algorithms (4th Edition) textbook,
written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

This is a part of my continuing eduction on the subject of data structures and algoritms in Java. Where possible
I attempt to follow the coding style and conventions used in the book, some of which I disagree with. This choice 
was made for consistancy and ease of understanding for anyone looking at this repository from the context of the book.
Code in this repository should *not* be used as an example of:

* Good java coding style or conventions
* How to write an algorithms library in java
