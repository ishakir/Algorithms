Algorithms
==========

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms following the Algorithms (4th Edition) textbook,
written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

This is a part of my continuing eduction on the subject of data structures and algoritms in Java. I've made it available
publically just in case anyone finds it interesting or useful, as some of my attempts at solutions to problems in the book
are here, alongside the actual algorithms and data structures in the text.

Where possible I attempt to follow the coding style and conventions used in the book, some of which I and the general Java
community disagree with. This choice was made for consistancy and ease of understanding for anyone looking at this repository from the context of the book. As such, code in this repository should *not* be used as an example of:

* Good java coding style or conventions
* How to write an algorithms library in java
